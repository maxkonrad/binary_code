EE142 BINARY CODE GENERATION

Binary code is a system of representing data using only two digits, 0 and 1. It is also known as the base-2 system because it uses only two possible values to represent numbers, just as the decimal or base-10 system uses 10 possible values (0 to 9) to represent numbers.

This code generates binary codes from 3-bit to 10-bit and prints out time elapsed during execution times in a text file.
